### Early Life and Education
Einstein grew up in a secular Jewish family. He showed an early interest in science and mathematics but struggled with the rigid school system. He eventually attended the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich, where he graduated in 1900.

### Career and Major Contributions

1. **Annus Mirabilis Papers (1905)**: In 1905, often referred to as his "miracle year," Einstein published four groundbreaking papers in the *Annalen der Physik* journal. These papers covered the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy, significantly advancing the field of theoretical physics.

2. **General Theory of Relativity (1915)**: Einstein's general theory of relativity, published in 1915, revolutionized the understanding of gravity. This theory proposed that gravity is a result of the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. It was confirmed by the observation of the bending of light from stars by the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1919, making Einstein an international celebrity.

3. **Nobel Prize (1921)**: Although Einstein is most famous for his work on relativity, he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which was pivotal in the development of quantum theory.

### Later Life and Legacy

Einstein moved to the United States in 1933 after Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. He took a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he remained until his death in 1955. During his later years, Einstein worked on a unified field theory, attempting to unify the forces of nature into a single theoretical framework, but he was not successful.

Einstein was also known for his advocacy for civil rights, pacifism, and Zionism. He was an outspoken critic of the Nazi regime and played a role in alerting the United States about the potential for Nazi Germany to develop atomic weapons, leading to the initiation of the Manhattan Project.

### Personal Traits and Influence
Einstein was known for his curious and independent mind. He had a great passion for music, often playing the violin as a form of relaxation. His approachable personality, combined with his distinctive appearance—wild hair and casual dress—made him a cultural icon.

### Impact on Modern Science
Einstein's theories have had a profound impact on the way we understand the universe. The theory of general relativity has been essential in the development of many modern technologies, such as GPS, and continues to influence the field of astrophysics, particularly in the study of black holes and the expansion of the universe.

Albert Einstein remains one of the most influential scientists of all time, symbolizing the power of human creativity and intellect. His contributions continue to inspire scientists and thinkers worldwide.
