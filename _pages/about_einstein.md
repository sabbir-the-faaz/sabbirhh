I am Md. Sabbir Rahman Akash, an Engineering graduate from one of the topmost engineering universities in Bangladesh, KUET. My passion lies in app and web development, AI, and ML, where I am driven by a relentless curiosity and a not-giving-up mindset. I thrive on connecting complex concepts and turning them into practical solutions, leveraging my ability to learn quickly, think critically, and generate ideas rapidly.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have showcased my strengths in problem-solving and leadership. I have led various research projects, including the development of an automated grading system for finished leather and pipeline corrosion detection using advanced machine learning techniques. My dedication to innovation is evident from my multiple awards, including winning the Best Poster Presentation Award for Outstanding Research and securing top positions in national competitions like the Red & White Innovation Olympiad and the Redesign IT-based Case Study Competition.

As the founder of ParallelX Academia and Neuronite Programming Club, I have demonstrated my commitment to knowledge sharing and community building. My technical expertise, combined with a strong background in data analytics, computer vision, and software engineering, positions me as a versatile and dynamic contributor to any team or project.
